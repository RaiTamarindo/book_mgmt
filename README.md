## Overview of Choices

1. Dependency Injection: I'll use Python's native capabilities to demonstrate DI by passing dependencies (e.g., cache backend, external API client) as arguments to functions or class constructors. This promotes testability and decoupling.
2. Dockerization: A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml will set up the environment for running Django and a database (PostgreSQL).
3. RESTful API: The Django REST Framework (DRF) will be used for simplicity and efficiency in building the CRUD API.
4. 3rd-Party Integration: The integration for data enrichment will fetch book details by ISBN (e.g., OpenLibrary API or Google Books API).
5. Caching: Django's caching framework will be utilized with a decorator to cache enriched data.
6. Type Hinting: To improve readability and enforce type safety, Python type hints will be used.
7. Documentation: A README will include setup instructions and design decisions.
